### About

I'm currently a 2nd year MPH student at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health with an anticipated graduation date of May 2021. I am in the Health Policy and Management department, currently doing my certificate in Applied Biostatistics. I received a BS in Psychology from Northeastern University in 2017 where I also minored in History and International Affairs. My previous work experience has been in neuroscience and immunology research. You can find out more about my past research experiences under [Resume](about.html).
